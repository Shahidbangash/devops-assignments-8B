  An application that can be installed on your mobile devices as well as can be used on a web browser, the application takes the video to recognize human faces and expressions as well as behavioral gestures and movements to understand behavior. In environments like meeting, presentation, classes, and conferences understanding the crowd’s interest level is very important for effective and impactful communication.

  Information gathering about people's interests is a major part of our industry and using it for better deliverables and product quality. One of the basic usage of this application could be, studentteacher evaluation forms will not be required if this application is used in classrooms to detect student's and teacher’s behavior and interests

### Deployment or Distribution Strategy

  As our system will be using Api request to detect face and expression which that why we have deployed our server to FIrebase Hosting and Heruko. Mobile User will send request to Firebase server and Web APP user will consume Heruko hosted server.However all user data will be kept in firebase Firestore.

### Architecture
